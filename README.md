# TensorFlow

# Script: Graph and Session

Description: Here, I present a simple and easy way to create a graph with its own session. Just as TensorFlow does.

# Script: Graph and Session Classification

Description: Here, I present a simple and easy way to create a graph with its own session to solve a simple classification problem. This is an extention of "Graph and session example" presented previously.

# Script: Linear_TensorFlow

Description: Here, I present a simple and easy way to create a linear regression with TensorFlow. In this case the data is created by linear equation y=w1x+w2z+b. No external files is needed.

# Script: MNIST_example_TensorFlow

Description: Here, I present a simple and easy way to create a typlical MNIST classification with TensorFlow.


# Script: APP_case

Description: Here, I present a simple and easy way to create a machine learning algorithm, which is able to predict if a customer will buy again.

# Script: TF_admission

Description: Here, I present a simple and easy way to create a linear regression with TensorFlow. In this case the data based on file Admission_Predict.csv. The targets are represented by the chance of admitance and the inputs are the CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average).

# Script: TF_polynomial_regression

Description: Here, I present a simple and easy way to create a polynomial linear regression with TensorFlow. In this case the data based on file Polynomial_test.csv. Dataset was created to emulate Y=ax³+bx²+c*x+d

# Script: TF_wine_quality

Description: Here, I present a simple and easy way to create a machine learning algorithm (ANN), which is able to predict wine quality. There are 11 inputs and one target. It is devided in two parts. In part I, only the prepicessing data is presented. The Machine learnig analysis (RNN) with Tensorflow can be found in part II.
The data set was obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/vishalyo990/prediction-of-quality-of-wine/data
